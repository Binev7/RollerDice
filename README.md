This project is a Dice Rolling Simulation Program written in Java. It allows users to input the number of dice they want to roll, simulates the rolls using random numbers, and displays the results visually as ASCII art for each die face. The program also calculates the total sum of the rolled dice values.

Key Features:
Dynamic Input: Users can specify the number of dice to roll.

Randomized Results: Each die roll is simulated using Java's Random class, generating values between 1 and 6.

Visual Representation: ASCII art is used to represent the faces of the dice (from 1 to 6).

Input Validation: Ensures the number of dice entered by the user is greater than zero.

Total Calculation: The program sums up and displays the total value of all rolled dice.
